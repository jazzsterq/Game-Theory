# Auction-Based Game Theory Simulations

## Overview
This project showcases two auction-based game theories, "Weight has it all" and "Royal Bidding Rivalry," aimed at studying bidder behavior and strategy in auction settings. These simulations blend theoretical auction concepts with practical application.

## Games Description
- **Weight has it all**: A First Price Auction based game where players strategize their bids in response to their own and competitors' previous bids.
- **Royal Bidding Rivalry**: Utilizes the Second Price Auction (Vickerey Auction) format with a unique payment rule, adding a layer of complexity to the bidding strategy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. GNU GCC compiler should be installed on the machine.

## Usage
- Execute `game1.cpp` for "Weight has it all."
- Execute `game2.cpp` for "Royal Bidding Rivalry."
